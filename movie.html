          Synopsis:
          <p>
            The Imperial Forces -- under orders from cruel Darth Vader (David
            Prowse) -- hold Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) hostage, in their
            efforts to quell the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Luke
            Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford), captain of the
            Millennium Falcon, work together with the companionable droid duo
            R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) to rescue the
            beautiful princess, help the Rebel Alliance, and restore freedom and
            justice to the Galaxy.

                As a visual cartoon, Star Wars is resolutely successful,
                phenomenal in its impact; as an emotional adventure, Star Wars
                is only bubblegum entertainment, tripping us back into a black
                and white world where good and evil can fight it out with ray
                guns.

                I don't see how I can come out ahead panning Star Wars, George
                Lucas's science-fiction film that has been acclaimed by children
                of all ages as the Fun Movie of the year.

                It's a "fun movie", as they say. Meaning that it doesn't mean
                anything, it's a superior, pop plaything to play with, to be
                innocently enjoyed and thrown away like a four-dollar comic
                book.
